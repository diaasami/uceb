# Ultimate Cheap Eats Berlin

A [map]() for Ultimate Cheap Eats Berlin, based on [this reddit thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/berlin/comments/oxois3/ultimate_cheap_eats_in_berlin_thread/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3)

The list of locations is in [input.txt](https://github.com/diaasami/uceb/blob/main/input.txt)
and when modified, gets added automatically to the map via a subsequent commit, 
this is done with the help of [build_geojson.py](https://github.com/diaasami/uceb/blob/main/build_geojson.py) and the github action [gen-geojson.yml](https://github.com/diaasami/uceb/blob/main/.github/workflows/gen-geojson.yml)
